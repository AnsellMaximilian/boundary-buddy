# Boundary Buddy

A simple web quiz game aimed towards children. It's comprised of different lessons, which themselves have a set of questions centered around the theme of their corresponding lessons. The main theme of this quiz is boundaries.

Each question of each lesson will have multiple choices. Upon incorrect and correct choices, the user will be given a proper explanation of why a particular choice is incorrect or correct, respectively.

The design is meant to be colorful and fun to stay light in mood while also effectively imparting important lessons to children about boundaries, respect, and vocalizing discomfort.

This app is also very extendible, meaning adding more questions and lessons will be very easy and quick.
